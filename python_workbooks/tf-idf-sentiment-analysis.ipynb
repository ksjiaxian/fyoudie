However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \\n\\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \\n\\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare.

The bar had some people, not too packed. We were seated in the dining room which was pretty empty for a Saturday night.\\n\\nOur waitress was very slow and inattentive. She took over 10 minutes just to come over and ask us to order our drinks. This should have been a sign of things to come. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. We each ordered a drink from the bar and it took around 15 minutes for our server to deliver the drinks. As soon as the drinks were delivered, she quickly scurried away to another table without even offering to take our dinner order. \\n\\nShe later returned with a plate of bread and olives which were pretty good and had a nice flavor. We then ordered an appetizer of burrata pugliese and also a caesar salad. The appetizer was good, no complaints there. The caesar salad was nicely presented and was made with fresh romaine. The salad was the best part of the whole dinner, kind of sad.\\n\\nDinner took a really long time - we both ordered the same dish, bolognese. The dish was nothing to write home about and very lackluster. The pasta was fresh, but overall the dish was bland and a small portion size. Our server was nowhere to be found the entire meal which was extremely frustrating. She came over well after we had finished the meal and asked if we wanted anything else - we said no and requested the bill. There was never anyone asking how the meal was, something that really irks me. We waited again, well over twenty minutes only for the waitress to return and ask us again if we wanted anything else. I guess our first answer wasn't sufficient or we were suddenly on Who Wants to be a Millionaire and she wanted to be sure that was our final answer? We waited around some more before she finally delivered the check. \\n\\nThis place is a big let down.

The second was a fried doughy pillow topped with prosciutto, arugula, and hand made burrata cheese.\\n- poached eggs over fresh made melted italian cheese finished with truffles shaved generously all over at the table by the chef himself. \\n- another of the brunch egg dishes featuring poached eggs over brisket with prosciutto and hand cut fries. \\n- pasta made fresh daily with pesto, for which the chef has won several awards.\\n- traditional and prosciutto pizza. these did not include any tomato sauces, but rather a creamy cheese beneath melted cheese on top. \\n- pockets similar to dumplings or ravioli filled with pork, rice, and vegetables in a delectable sauce\\n- for dessert: a panna cotta with 40 year aged balsamic, and a chocolate dessert, having a similar texture to the panna cotta, with amaretti cookies and salted caramel.\\n\\nEverything was so finely prepared and absolutely excellent. With each dish we truly felt that it was made with meticulous care and attention to detail. We really thought everything tasted perfectly. The portions were also nice if you want to have antipasti, a main, and dessert. They were not so expensive or filling that you could not experience the whole menu. On that note, the prices are very fair for the superb quality, and most dishes were available in half portions.\\n\\nThey wine and beer offerings were really nice.

The prosciutto was like none I had had before and the the tart & pastry were nice surprises.  For our meal I ordered the lasagna and my husband ordered the braised pork.  We traded halfway through but I was reluctant to because my lasagna was the best pasta I have EVER had.  The noodles were paper thin and practically melted in my mouth.  This lasagna is not your overly cheesy kind nor is it some vegetable imposter.  The flavor is refined and begs you to come back for more.  The pork was equally \"melt-in-your-mouth\" delicious.  It is definitely worth trying but I am such a pasta girl, I would order the lasagna again next time.

Par for the course and please read below before spending money at prides:\\n\\nThe first time was when we were at Prides for dinner when we sat at the bar.  We had a full dinner with appetizers and were pleasantly happy with everything, particularly the food.  Unfortunately, when it came time for dessert we ordered but then waited about 45 minutes with nothing coming.  The bartender finally noticed, apologized, and had them bring out the dessert immediately.  He also offered to comp the dessert due to the delay, which we felt was appropriate.  When we were ready to pay the bartender gave us our tab, I looked at it briefly noticing that there wasn\\'t a dessert on it, as promised, and we put out our card.  Another female bartender then came over to grab our tab, rang it up, and gave it back to us.  Imagine my shock when I go to sign and notice the total is not the same as it was before.  I discovered that the female bartender had taken the card, added the dessert to it, and gave it back to me.  I was so shocked it had happened in light of the fact that she had in effect added additional money after I had only approved the prior price given the prior bill and handed over my card.  The behavior was so shocking that we left no tip, I circled the dessert on the bill to explain, and left.\\n\\nDespite the prior experience, we came again probably a month or so later to give it a second chance.  This time we came on a Thursday thinking it wouldn\\'t be very busy.  We sat at the bar again and it was much busier than anticipated.  Everything should have been fine and the food we did get was good, but the service again was disappointing.  It seemed as though there should have been 2 bartenders on to help, and we weren\\'t sure whether someone had just not shown up for his or her shift or there had been only 1 bartender on that night.  Regardless, the poor bartender was trying his best to keep up with the bar and service station, but was completely failing leading to a number of angry patrons at the bar.  We completely did not blame the bartender as he was completely over his head, but the more frustrating part was that no one, including the owner who we did see there that night, did nothing to help him.  This display of exceptionally poor management was again, disappointing. \\n\\nFinally, even though we had two disappointing experiences, we gave it one last try- 3 strikes if you will.  We came again on a weekday and this time the bar was, in fact, not busy at all.  Us and another couple were the only ones there at the time.  Soon after another group of men came in and sat at the bar.  They seem to have had similar experiences as we later heard them tell the bartender they call this place the \"50-50\" in that it is good about half the time.  Not a good thing for customers to be saying so easily.  Regardless, my husband ordered a drink and I just had water given that we recently found out I was pregnant.  We wanted to order an appetizer and we have had the burratta cheese appetizer before and liked it.  Given my condition; however, before ordering from the bartender we asked if the cheese was pasteurized, given that unpasteurized products are deadly for unborn babies.  My husband even gave the bartender an out and said, if you or the chef don\\'t know, just say you don\\'t know.  The bartender had no idea, but went to go ask the chef.  He soon came back and instead of clarifying, gave us what we took as a very sarcastic remark that \"ALL cheese in the US is pasteurized.\"  We were shocked.  I understand the FDA rules regarding pasteurization as I\\'ve educated myself during the pregnancy and love different and unique cheeses.  But this comment was not only completely unnecessary it is also misleading.  There are MANY restaurants, farmers markets even grocery stores like Whole Foods and Market Basket that sell types of unpasteurized cheeses.  So to assume that because we are in the US that all cheese is ok is misleading, dangerous, and, frankly, lazy given the chef\\'s profession.  That comment was the nail in the coffin for us and we immediately paid for the one drink and left.\\n\\n We have no intention of returning to Prides given our experience, particularly the comments during my pregnancy.  \\n\\nThus, I write this email as a warning from a Beverly citizen in the hope that not only do you make some changes but know that if things continue I anticipate seeing a new restaurant in your space soon enough.', 'date': '2014-08-03 23:24:10'}, {'review_id': '92d0ElSVY-PPtcAXw1IMSQ', 'user_id': '4w7TXcPola5W7Mf_8xJi5A', 'business_id': 'buF9druCkbuXLX526sGELQ', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Went there for the second time tonight.

My roommate and I went down for a few drinks over the weekend, and were really impressed with the bartenders.  I'm not usually a cocktail guy, but the mixology put into their drinks are outstanding.  Most of their juices are hand squeezed that day, the selection is unique, and the bar staff was very knowledgeable, and attentive.

He even took me through step by step as he made it in front of me.  \\n\\nLast night I went to the restaurant side with my girlfriend.  I was very impressed with know knowledgeable the wait-staff was with the menu, she really did a great job describing her favorites, and taking us through the highlights of each menu item. The menu is smaller than other Italian restaurants in the area, but their dishes are original. Their app selection are delicious, they have a 'farm board' which lists out all the daily meats and cheeses they use from local organic farms, getting hormone-free meat.  I can't remember the name of our appetizer, but it was a warm baked-bread with soft creamy cheese inside, wrapped in prosciutto.  Outstanding.  For our meal, she got the Chef's (2008 world's best apparently) Pesto, with fresh, hand-made pasta.  I'm not a big pesto person, but this was delicious, the basil gave it such a fresh crisp taste.  I got the Ravioli, which came recommended, that did not disappoint either.  The portions were not overwhelming, but I didn't leave hungry.  We also tried dessert, which was quite authentic.  \\n\\nPrides Osteria is not typical to the Rantoul St. scene, but with quality like that, it comes most welcomed!

An appetizer special, which was labeled as tomato crostini turned out to be a sugary blend of tomato puree on top of a pie crust - more fitting for a desert. A vegetarian entry that we requested came back as a concoction of all the vegetables that they could find in the kitchen, in a weird blend of undercooked beets, potatoes, green beans, and whatever else was lying around. The pesto pappardelle, which was the main attraction in the days of Paolo Laboa was a dull green mess.\\nOn the positive side, the manager was gracious, and took off the tomato appetizer off our bill, once he realized that we did not like it.

By Italian, they don\\'t mean \"Italian American\", you won\\'t find chicken parmigiana or spaghetti and meatballs. Rather, they serve something closer to authentic Italian \"peasant food\", adapted for the stubborn American palette.\\n\\nFor example, the \"farm board\", a serving of cured meats and cheeses with finger pastry as a vehicle for shuttling combinations of the ingredients into your mouth, was quite tasty. However, they chose \"safe\" selections in familiar shapes.. sopressata, hot coppa and wheel romano, with fluffy buttery pastry. I\\'ve never seen anything like it around here, but when I have seen it in other parts of the world, it incorporates fun things you don\\'t see everyday... goat cheese, jams, different kinds of bread. Perhaps they are still testing the waters, but I wanted to see them push the authenticity just a little more. That said, all of the ingredients on the board were top-quality, and absolutely did not disappoint.\\n\\nThe courses we had were very solid. A little heavy on oil and butter, perhaps, but the flavors came together nicely, and the fresh handmade pasta was succulent... I wanted more! I also appreciated the absence of salt and pepper at the table. I respect that, and didn\\'t once miss it... oil/butter comment aside, the food was perfectly balanced.\\n\\nThe wine selection was concise but impressive, and reasonably priced. I was pleased to see several Sangiovese and Chianti varietals. While I could buy a bottle at a liquor store for the price of a glass served here in some cases, I have seen many of the wines offered at a higher margin in other restaurants. The selection of beer was sparse, but there was something for everyone.

I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\\n\\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\\n\\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.\", 'date': '2011-10-27 14:32:57', 'bid': 'TA1KUSCu8GkWP9w0rmElxw'}\n",

When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn't see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention - which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. \\n\\nVanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work (my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE!

At the time I got the chickpea fries, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead (though I didn't get any at 12 pm haha).  The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously.\\n\\nThe real topping to the experience (other than the great service and the fact that they put lemons in their complimentary ice water) was that they were playing Siouxsie and the Banshees in the background!
