I always order the tri tip for myself. It's covered and cilantro which is a plus for me but if you don't like cilantro then this may not be for you. I've tried their other meats from some of my friends such as their brisket and pulled pork which are both delicious options. As far as their sides go, there are so many options to choose from! Some of you may find it very difficult to even pick one! My favorite of them all is their cornbread. That corn bread is so damn good. They make the cornbread with jalape√±os so it gives it a nice subtle kick of heat! Some of their other sides options like their baked beans may be basic but nonetheless good in taste. \\n\\nAlso I recently went here when it was my friends birthday. One of the employees engaged us in a friendly conversation upon noticing that we had a cupcake. When they learned that it was someone's birthday they kindly got a birthday card and had the employees of 4 Rivers sign it and wish our friend a happy birthday! The staff overall was friendly.\\n\\nDon't be intimidated if their is a long line, it goes by quick and they also have separate lines for pick up and to go orders!\",\n",

It's really good and it's probably one of my top recommendations. \\n\\nThe sides is where I believe that this place really shines. All the sides I have tried from here have been great. I recommend the corn and Mac and cheese. Also the bacon wrapped jalape√±os are a must! They're not really spicy and they're delicious without being overly greasy. \\n\\nThey have this really amazing bakery on the inside near the back that is most probably my favorite part of coming here (and I'm not a sweets person). They cupcakes are all amazing, the peanut butter cup and birthday cake are my favorites! \\n\\nThey also make an amazing cupcake drop shake in which they mix a cupcake of your choice with vanilla or chocolate ice-cream. It's amazing and it will change your life. The shake is great, just imagine having little pieces of a delicious cupcake in a shake. I'm craving one as I write this review right now! I personally like the birthday cake cupcake with vanilla ice cream. \\n\\nOverall, if you haven't visited this place yet I suggest that you do!

We had never dined in, so we were confused as to where the entrance was, as people were walking in through the side awning; and, through the front. \\n\\nWe settled on the front; and, found the bakery counter. Not wanting to start with dessert, we made our way passed the long, community tables, to the queue. You have to look at the menu, decide what you want, and then \"build\" your meal by selecting your meat, sides, etc. It\\'s kind of like the Chipotle of BBQ.\\n\\nThere are no plates, the meat is plopped unceremoniously right on the paper, lining your tray, however, the sides are served in small Styrofoam containers. I am not sure if this is economy or ecology driven; but, that\\'s how it works. Bottled drinks, OOPS, are in the refrigerated section as you walk up, so grab a drink BEFORE you get to where you order!\\n\\nI ordered the burnt ends dinner; but, the meat was way past over cooked, a bit mushy and not nearly as smoky as I hoped. I am glad I asked to substitute some of the burnt ends for brisket, as the brisket is much, much better. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the Beef Rib (what they call the Brontosaurus); and, it was spectacular. I\\'ve never seen a rib with so much meat, which tasted so good; and, was so tender. At nearly double the price of everything on the menu, it\\'s a treat for sure.\\n\\nAfter assembling our meal, the bill came, with room for a tip. I foolishly added 10%. I didn\\'t know I would have to get my own silverware, find my own place to sit, wrap up my leftovers to-go; and, bus my own table... no tip going forward; sorry folks!',\n",

It is a great lunch place and good for quick dinners. \\n\\nI'm a brisket girl. The fattiest piece off that cap fat is mine. It fat make its oh so juicy and tender at the same time protecting all the meat from the heat. It is extremely tender but I'm warning you the seasoning on the outside layer could sky rocket your blood pressure through the roof because of the sodium level. However, I still dig it. The rest of the meat variety are okay. My next fave would probably be the prime rib but sandwich style. The dinner style has it sliced pretty thin and I think that is such a waste of a good lookin steak. I only like sliced pork very thin. (I know i'm picky!!)\\n\\nOn to the sides, my current faves are their jalapeno sweet corn bread, roasted corn and cole slaw. In my opinion the corn bread wins miles over their biscuit. It is sweet, moist, light on the top but gets denser toward the bottom and has a kick from the jalapeno. The biscuit recipe could use a little tweaking because its often kind of dry and not warm. The sad thing is that adding butter to it doesn't help much. Bummer. Any ways, back to my other faves. The roasted corn is smokey and delicious and the cole slaw is refreshing against all the warm offerings. \\n\\nI think the best idea is to get a dinner plate (~10-17 dollars) and split it into 2 meals. I promise there will be plenty if you can control yourself and not eat the whole thing in one sitting. \\n\\nThe Sweet Shop is here too but I can't comment on that cause I honestly don't remember how I felt about it since I haven't ordered in awhile. \\n\\nLunch around this area is getting pretty popping. Thanks 4Rivers you are in my repertoire of restaurants for lunch!  \\n\\nTIP: They have a rewards card that allows patrons to get a free meal (?? or something like that) on every 10 visits. Just do a quick sign up on their website!\",\n",

Fast forward many years, and now 4 Rivers has multiple locations, plenty of parking, and seating options with air conditioning.\\n\\nThey have a few fancy sandwiches with different toppings, but I gravitate towards the simpler meats. The pulled pork and beef brisket - order them! They are my favorites here. You can request a fattier or leaner piece of brisket and they will happily accommodate. Either way, the meat is incredibly tender and moist. Or if you feel like splurging, go for the burnt ends. So so so good. \\n\\nIn terms of sides, my top picks are the sweet potato casserole and collard greens.

The main food is exactly the same as the other locations, as it should be: meaty, hearty, and comforting. It used to be so crowded that you'd probably be in line for 30 minutes, but I think that phase has passed. With that being said, parking is not a trouble either. If you're a first timer- get the sample sliders in order to get a taste of a good portion of their menu in one plate offering. Regarding the sweetshop though, particularly their cupcakes, I felt that the cake parts themselves are moist and flavorful. However, thee icing isn't very satisfying. I am not baker but I think perhaps that they put too much of the flavor of the icing in it(chocolate, vanilla, cheerwine), as it is just too overpowering.

I ordered one of their signature stackers, the Messy Pig, with two sides: the crispy creme bread pudding and their sweet potato casserole. You mind as well opt for the sides due to the price of one side alone. More to take home later! Ask them what flavor of bread pudding they have. They switch them out apparently!  I can't wait to come back and try other flavors from them. The crispy creme one was so delectable though. You will not regret it. The sweet potato casserole was rich and delicious as well. And...there are no words for how good and filling the sandwich is...just try it! And douse it with your favorite bbq sauce, whether that be sweet or spicy, you can't go wrong.

       "  'text': \"4Rivers is a place you can really feel good about eating at. Although my latest visit was a quick in & out to pick up a quick takeout for dinner, I have been a big fan 4Rivers since they opened their first place.  Their bbq is top notch, it doesn't matter if you are a beef, chicken, or pork fan -you will not be disappointed. The brisket is their signature and boy is it delish! They offer well made, make your mouth water, home style sides like macaroni & cheese, collards, okra, and southern green beans.  This is NOT the place to eat if you want your veggies steamed and crunchy.  But if like me you were raised on grandma's home cooking - or you only wish you had a grandma who knew her way around a side of bacon - then you will think you have died and gone to heaven.  Many of the 4R locations also include a Sweet Shop, so if you haven't filled up on brisket and collards, you can top off your meal with a selection of sugary treats.  My personal favorite are the 7 layer bars, just like Grandma used to make, except she called them Hello Dolly Cookies.  Over the years I have also worked multiple times with 4Rivers catering. The folks who take care of the catering business are just as top notch as the people in their restaurants. The quality is just as good when they bring the meal to you and service is top notch and then some. \\n\\nTo touch base very quickly on 4Rivers the company, I was lucky enough to be a guest at a YMCA breakfast where Johnny Rivers, the founder spoke about how he came to start the company and his corporate philosophy. You can feel good about supporting this company by eating at its restaurants. They are good corporate citizens who support the communities where they make their homes. \\n\\nSo, what else can I say but 4R!\",\n",

But to the credit of the establishment they have the option for a moist or lean cut and I suppose that if you don't choose they default you lean meat. I'm sure the moist option is probably what I'm looking for is all. Now that that's out of the way! Do not be mislead the food is great! The Mac and cheese is super cheesy and yummy and the bread is definitely soft and delicious. They ambience is neat very college area vibe which you should expect being next to ucf. They have an array of sodas and juices for you to choose from! 2 other things to note is that they have a barrel in the front that you can wash your hands at which I thought was really neat and a separate section for sweets which looks super tasty but I have to try! Overall good place to grab a bite! O and their bbq sauce is more tangy and sweet than regular sauces so heads up!\",\n",

The barbecue and general ambience are two of the most exceptional things about this place. The place is always spotless even at its most busy times. It is a great place to get stuffed with barbecue and amazing sides with a large group of friends. One of the biggest issues that has developed over the years with Four Rivers is that their attempts at franchising has come at the cost of its uniqueness. The food is very consistent now where as before some days they would experiment and use slightly different recipes. This led to the occasional disappointment such as too salty or soggy brisket but it would also lead to some amazing concoctions.

I went for lunch around noon and the line moved quickly. I ordered a smokehouse salad and added brisket. The salad was huge and I loved all of the toppings, especially the cornbread croutons! They also make the dressings in house and the ranch was pretty good. I'll definitely be back very soon to try their other items!\",\n",

Interestingly, I had the sandwich come out on a plate initially at the register. But then the cashier returned it to the window, because (I think) that particular one might have been for a take out order and might have had no smokehouse relish. Anyway, I was given the little sign as usual so that the staff can deliver the sandwich to me fresh.\\n\\nGot the smoked jalapenos as a side (never had them before), and really liked them - nice flavor, stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. And of course, as always, had the bread pudding.\\n\\nI finished all my sides before I was approached by an employee who apologized for my long wait. He offered me another complimentary side because of it and I got another order of smoked jalapenos since I had enjoyed them so much! I think I ended up waiting 15-20 minutes for the Longhorn since something seems to have happened in the kitchen.\\n\\nThe sandwich was excellent as usual. I was just a little disappointed in the wait time, as I never experienced that before at this location. However, they definitely tried to make things right by offering the extra side and that means something to me in this day and age. Props to good customer service.',\n",

The sausage was excellent, great flavor with a good snap on the casing. I got Mac & Cheese it was what you expect, cheesy, goopey and the macaroni was cooked to way past al dente. I also got cole slaw to balance out the flavors. There are two sauces on the table and they are very good, the hot has a little bit of bite but not extreme heat. It's good BBQ and consistent.

       "  'text': 'Had heard a lot about how good Four Rivers is to the extent that I thought it was an evening dining place. Nope. This is picnic table level old fashioned barbecue where it\\'s highly likely you\\'ll be rubbing elbows with people sitting on seats right next to you.  No private booths here. I adjusted my sensibilities accordingly and forged ahead. Many tables were occupied both inside and out so we concluded that finding a seat might be challenging. The wife decided to strike out to secure a table for us while I ordered and she was successful. I selected a sliced pork sandwich for myself and a pulled pork sandwich for the missus, figuring these must be representative staples of their line of barbecue meats.  We both opted for sides of fries and mac and cheese. The sliced pork was tasty where there was meat but disappointing at the discernably fatty spots beyond the incidental fat  that you expect in a sandwich. Nothing more bothersome than biting into \"bubbles\" of nearly pure fat. Aren\\'t they supposed to trim excessive fat?  My wife enjoyed her pulled pork sandwich but I was wondering if it was because the fat was obscured by virtue of being shredded. We both loved the bread it was on and their sweet barbecue sauce was the barbecue bomb. I liked the crunchy larger crinkle-cut fries but my wife did not. A good mac and cheese can win the day for me but, alas, this concoction was a lesson in blandness for both of us. The order takers did not ask if I wanted a drink so I thought it might be included in the price. Nope. Wife went back and purchased drinks for us. I give the place a 5.5 based on this one experience, my wife rates it around a 5.0 after factoring in ambience, service and taste.  Given its rep, we expected a helluva lot more. Doubt we will be back.',\n",

       "  'text': 'When it comes to barbecue, people can be pretty picky. I can see this in some of the other reviews, but to each their own.\\n\\nI come here nearly every weekend. Always find myself satisfied. This place specializes in Texas-style barbecue, so if you\\'re expecting stuff simmering in a sweet sauce, this isn\\'t going to live up to your expectations. Naturally, the focus is going to be on brisket.\\n\\nI always go between the Texas Destroyer (brisket smothered in provolone, onion rings, and jalapenos), Longhorn (brisket and smoked sausage w/ provolone, onion rings, and relish), Messy Pig (pulled pork between two layers of slaw), and the Smokehouse Sliders (you pick 3 meats). All of them are always good. I\\'m also really surprised every time by how good the pulled chicken is on the sliders!\\n\\nFrom the sides, I have to give a special mention to the bread pudding. They have a \"crispy cream\" on Mon/Wed/Fri and a bananas foster on Tues/Thurs/Sat. Always one of my favorites - you\\'re getting a dessert as a regular side! The \"crispy cream\" is a bit sweeter, and the bananas foster is more savory, but the caramelized part on the bottom is always great!\\n\\nThe only negative I have to give is that some of the sides are not as good as others. I feel the green beans need just a little kick in them, the mac and cheese is a bit underwhelming, and the potato salad is also a little bland. The fries are crinkle cut, so nothing special there. Most of the other sides, though, are really great.\\n\\nThe staff here is always friendly and give great consistent service. All in all a great place to come for some good barbecue during the week.',\n",

It fell apart using a plastic fork. 3 of the 4 pieces were perfect, but one of them was super fatty. The sides: macaroni was perfectly tender and super cheesy-- the kind of cheddary cheesy deliciousness that mac n cheese is defined by. Sweet potato casserole was smooth and nutty, not too sweet. The coleslaw was super delicious, but not wet, so if you like a \"juicy\" coleslaw, this isn\\'t it--but it\\'s still the perfect accompaniment to the brisket.\\n\\nI also got dessert-- banana pudding.

       "  'text': \"Everyone raves about 4 Rivers. Everyone. So, I had this place built up in my mind to be something amazing. It was very good but I don't necessarily think it is the best BBQ I've had. I'll go with the sides first. They were amazing. The mac and cheese and the baked beans were cooked perfectly. Definitely the best sides I've had at a BBQ joint in Orlando. The BBQ on the other hand seemed plain to me. Both the brisket and the pulled pork sandwich were good but I didn't think the meat was different than other places. The two sauces you can add to them also seemed plain. Tasty but it left me wanting more. They have a huge dessert selection too.\\n\\nThis location gets packed. The line can snake out the door and around the corner so come early and prepare to wait. It moves fast though and there is usually a place to sit, even if it is outside under the covered porch.\\n\\nOverall, this is a good restaurant choice in the UCF area. I'll be back and you should too.\",\n",

My brother had the three slides with sweet potato and the smoked jalape√±os, he joyfully devoured his meal!

For desert, I was guided towards a homemade strawberry pop tart at the bakery...wonderful!

The Mac was creamy and hot, green beans have some meat and had a nice spicy kick. The salad had a lot of peppers and I'm not a big fan but it was fresh. The sweet tea was not sweet so you will need to add sugar. The one thing that looked fantastic but choose not to have any as I'm trying to diet was the deserts.

We were able to beat the dinner rush and get right in line. Ordered the Texas destroyer ( my favorite) with sweet potato and fries. Gf ordered the pulled chicken dinner with baked beans, fries, and Mac and cheese. She later regretted it and stated that the dinner plate brings too much food for 1 person. Probably could have split the meal. Everything tasted perfect. The brisket on my sandwich was  smoked to perfection and added a little bit of their BBQ sauce. All the flavors blend together to form the perfect BBQ sand which. Gf loved the pulled chicken and all her sides . \\n\\nThe restaurant was clean as usual. Plenty of seats and plenty of employees working the counter. Very efficient. The rush of people started to come around 715 PM. They now offer tacos for taco Tuesday which looked delicious. They also have a sweet shop which offers delicious desserts. We did not try them this time but will try next time. Always recommend this place if you are looking for a. Ice quick and delicious dinner at an affordable price. One of Orlando's best!!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I was brought to this 4 Rivers Smokehouse with claims that it was one of the most popular restaurants in the Orlando area, and after my own personal experience there, I think it's easy to see why it is.\\n\\nNot being a local, I can't necessarily give too much about its location, other than the fact that it's very close to UCF.  But I also recall that it is right next to a Wawa, and as someone who grew up in Wawa territory, this was a very welcome revelation.  Parking is free and plentiful, and from the exterior, it's clear that this is primarily a sit-down or take-out kind of restaurant.\\n\\nEntering the restaurant, you're welcomed by the succulent meaty aroma of cooked meat of creatures lower on the food chain.  As for the seating itself, this 4 Rivers had a handful of tables meant for smaller parties, but for the most part there are numerous long tables meant for communal dining and the occasional need to sit next to strangers.  It's slightly more of the same on the patio.\\n\\nFor whatever reason, a large portion of the establishment is a bakery appearing to sell a large variety of cupcakes, and other sweet baked goods.  Sure, they all looked fantastic in their own right, but I did find it a little odd in its presence.  If anything at all, the typical sweet baked aroma of freshly baked pastries and desserts is completely negated by the smell of barbecue that permeates the entire place.\\n\\nOrdering is done before seating, and I had just arrived at the very tail end of a Friday lunch rush, as the line was long upon entering, but didn't gratifyingly get longer after me.  I ended up ordering a burnt ends stacker, which came with two sides, to which I chose collards and cheese grits.\\n\\nUltimately, I ate outside because it was a beautiful day, and it added to my enjoyable experience.  The sandwich's portion of meat was generous and heaping, and despite looking kind of like a messy sloppy joe in appearance, the flavor was phenomenal.  I love burnt ends to begin with, but the way 4 Rivers kind of mashes them together prior to serving allows for a lot of charred, smoky flavor to burst through, without feeling like you're chewing leather.  The house sauces both erred on slightly sweet, but both were enjoyable.  Maybe a little heat for the supposed hot variant, but it's nothing to have a legitimate gripe about.\\n\\nSides are where I tend to become critical with barbecue joints, because so often times I've been to places where the barbecue is great, but the sides underwhelm.  4 Rivers did not fall into that category for me, as the collards were slightly sweet, but had good tang and an overall flavor.  They don't bother to hide the use of pork juice when making either, which as a carnivorous glutton, is the only way.  The cheese grits are made in the fashion where they can served as patties instead of in a cup or anything, but were still good, without being bland or having flavors too separated to be enjoyable together.\\n\\nOverall, everything about my experience at 4 Rivers was fantastic.  A generous portion of lunch was definitely not outrageously priced at like $12, and the quality of the meats as well as the sides were top-notch.  It did not seem like a nuisance to get to, the parking was a cinch, the atmosphere was jovial and the establishment was clean.  I would most definitely want to come back in my future trips to Orlando.  It's really about as an easy five stars as I can possibly give.\",\n",

Recently found myself back in the UCF area and had to convince my friends to try it. \\n\\nThis location has a very nice layout to it that you can tell was well planned. There is a comforting ranch style vibe to the restaurant that is perfect for a bbq joint. Right when you pull up you smell the delicious woody aroma. The restaurant is casual you wait in a line order your food and watch them carve your meat right in front of you. Then you pay, sit and eat. \\n\\nThe staff was very friendly to me and will answer questions if your a little confused about what something means. \\n\\nI decided to order the Texas twosome which is great because you can choose two type of meats. I got pulled pork and brisket (I also recommend burnt ends they are delicious) with a side of French fries and fried okra. Everything was great and flavorful and went well with their sauces. I have come here many times with the idea that somehow I will save room for dessert but I never can but no fear for this exact reason you can go to the separate baking area where they have all the desserts of the day nicely displayed so you don't have to wait in the long line again. Here they will nicely pack-up your dessert so that you can enjoy it later. They also make milkshakes that they blend an entire one of their large cupcakes into (I have only been able to get this once pretty much as a meal and it was delicious. \\n\\nSo next time I am near one of these I will be coming back!\",\n",

The menu doesn't offer much for trying multiple meats, except the sliders where you choose three. I was thinking about that until the good people at 4 Rivers helped me out. I'm recommending this place to you and others because of them.\\n\\nThe team there introduced me to the Messy Cow. It's their Messy Pig but with brisket in place of the pork. Wow was it a great sandwich. Lots of it too. Get a fork to help tackle this beast. Got the sweet potato casserole and cornbread for sides. Both were good choices with lots of flavor and the cornbread being the right amount of soft.\\n\\nAll of the people working here were great; friendly and helpful.

One of the servers offered us a taste of the beef brisket right off the grill, and it was hot, tender and juicy and melted in your mouth,  I'm a purist about my barbecue and don't think of beef as real barbecue, but this was amazing and I ended up ordering it along with sausage and three sides:  bacon wrapped jalapenos, smokehouse corn, and cole slaw.  Everything was just as delicious as before.  My wife got the Messy Pig sandwich, shredded pork, layered with slaw, pickles and jalapenos, as did my mother-in-law.  My wife had sides of sweet potato casserole and cole slaw, and my mother-out-law\\n ;-) got the cole slaw and collards, and they both pronounced theirs delicious as well.  The in-house bakery, called The Sweetery, greets you in coming in the door, and is impossible to resist even though we were stuffed.  They chose the snickerdoodle cupcake and we all had a bite--like eating what heaven should taste like!  This will be a regular stop for us when in Orlando.\",\n",

That's the type of bbq I grew up on in NC. They don't have vinegar sauce but their sauces are good. Not too thick or ketchupy. I like the spicy one. Not all that spicy, just a little. \\nOne of my favorite things about this place is the variety of regional sodas. Seriously deciding what to drink is my hardest decision here. They have Ale 8, which I've never seen outside of KY. They have sun drop and cheerwine which I grew up drinking in NC and couldn't find at all in FL until a couple of years ago. The best part all if this stuff comes in glass bottles which to me is the best way to drink a soda. If that tiny glass bottle isn't going to cut it for you they also have cheerwine in the fountain. \\n\\nFor sides, I always get fried pickles. They are my fave food ever. I've been disappointed with the Mac n cheese before but either this location is better or I got a fresh batch because it was hot, creamy, and delish today. My grit cake was a bit lackluster today. Biscuits are good. I recommend sharing a plate so you can get dessert such as a cheerwine cupcake!\",\n",

I got burnt ends, pulled pork, bread pudding, cheesy grits, sweet potato casserole, fried pickles, baked beans, potato salad, and like these stuffed jalape√±o things. I thought the burnt ends were good and flavorful. Plus I liked that there was two kinds of meat. I didn't like the pulled pork it just looked like a greasy unidentifiable mess to me. The potato salad seemed to liquidy to me. Baked beans and sweet potato casserole were good but nothing I haven't had before. The fried pickles were awful way to much batter. The bread pudding was good. It's really kind of a desert item. The grits are solid more like a soft bread rather then grits and aren't a bad option. My favorite of the sides are the jalape√±os but they give you a tiny portion. You get a fairly large portion of meat with the dinner options. Probably wouldn't go again on my own.

Since this is a new establishment, the lines were really long (even around 4pm on a friday) so be prepared to wait for a bit (~20 mins ish); but then since this is near ucf the lines will always be long...I mean, who doesn't love some old fashion bbq?! I could eat it everyday.\\n\\nIf you don't have time to wait in line, call ahead so you can pick it up!\\n\\nI got the burnt ends (which is basically 1/2 brisket and 1/2 pulled pork) with the baked bbq beans and fried okra as my sides. FULLY drench that meat in the 4r sauce then get ready for an orgasmic experience in your mouth...dirty thinkers go away. Seriously, I could drink the 4r sauce by itself. Every time I took a bite from my sandwich I douse the bite area with more sauce...just by writing I'm salivating already :3!  From the looks of it, the meal looks pretty small..but once you eat, you will become stuffed. I didn't get a chance to finish off my fried okra so I took it home! The baked beans were awesome, while the fried okra was very light and wasn't heavy. Very good.\\n\\nTo end of the meal, I got two cupcakes from their bake shop: Chocolate Birthday and Grasshopper. The total of just two cupcakes came out around ~$7...and thats hella pricey; the quality is comparable to the publix bakery, so its best to use the $7 for cupcakes at publix..you can get more than two there! However, the chocolate cake was very moist even after eating it a day or two old. There is alot of frosting, so be prepared to cut the cupcake in half and make it into a sandwich so you can distribute the frosting. And don't put it in the refrigerator as it would make the frosting rock hard (if do just put it in room temp for a while). \\n\\nWhenever I go back to 4rivers I shall stick with the meats!\",\n",

Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Baked Beans...  with that said, 4Rivers has the most pathetic, flavorless, greasy, brisket of any restaurant I have ever had.  Once you finish removing the globs of fat from the small mound of greasy meat that is referred to as brisket, it lacks any real flavor besides slight traces of liquid smoke.  The pulled pork was better than the brisket, but severely lacked flavor and needed a lot of sauce to make it worth chewing on.  All was not lost though, I will admit that the baked beans were pretty freaking delicious as were all the sides I tasted.  The cheddar grits are a hidden treasure wrapped in aluminum foil and the bread pudding should not be overlooked as it may be a worthwhile bite away from entering into a sugar coma.  Overall, if you go here just for the sides you will be pleasantly surprised.  However, if you love great bar-b-que, than you would be better off driving quickly past this place and sparing your taste buds and wallet the disappointment.  I do think it's worth mentioning that all the staff are very friendly and welcoming.  Come on 4Rivers... I really want to like this place, but the meat is just so dreadfully bad!\",\n",

And please please do not second guess if you wanna wait because the line is out the door, it moves quickly and is sooooo worth the wait!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This place seems to be all about customer service. When we arrived at 10:30, an employee opened the door and welcomed us in. As we walked in we noticed that the hours on the door said they close at 9:00pm. When we asked the employee if they were closed he just smiled and said \"Not at all. Come on in!\" There were still a ton of people inside but the line wasn\\'t long. The employees were really friendly and cheerful despite the fact that it was more than 1.5 hours past closing time. When we got to the register we asked again what their hours are. She said that it\\'s normally 9:00 but they have an \"open door policy\". The employees genuinely seemed like they were happy to be there. That\\'s something you don\\'t see very often, especially in the food industry. \\n\\nOn top of the great service and friendly staff, the food turned out to be amazing. The sandwich was so good it was gone before I had a chance to put sauce on it. We also tried the fried pickles, BBQ baked beans, and banana bread pudding, all of which were delicious. They even had Cheerwine as a fountain drink. Who has Cheerwine on fountain!? The \"Sweet Shop\" had tons of great looking cakes, muffins and assorted pastries made right there in the store. Didn\\'t get a chance to try any but we\\'re saving room for dessert next time. \\n\\nGreat overall experience at 4R. Highly recommend checking them out if you haven\\'t already.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I'm kind of sad to be writing this review because l really wanted to like Four Rivers. I'd been wanting to try it for a while but every time I went to the Winter Park location, the line was out the door and I always ended up going somewhere else. So when I heard that the University location was opening, I was excited to give it a try. After all, with all the hype surrounding Four Rivers, how could it not be good?\\n\\nI'll tell you how.\\n\\nWhen my boyfriend and I got there, we were excited. It was spacious with a ton of seating and a whole wall of specialty sodas and artisan root beers. They're a little pricey, but were very tasty. Also, there was a very small line, but we did go around nine at night so that might have something to do with it. The people who were serving us were really exceptionally nice. They went out of their way to constantly bring us things and the service alone merited the two stars as opposed to the one almost gave. I ordered a pulled chicken sandwich and got fried okra and cornbread as my sides. \\n\\nFor the amount I paid, I expected a little better than to have my food placed on a lunch tray with a piece of paper that they also wrote on with crayon and permanent marker. I found this to be kind of gross and also found a hair on my tray, but since it wasn't touching my food, I disposed of it and tried to enjoy my meal. The sandwich itself was okay. The sauce is not nearly as good as everyone makes it out to be, but it is better than you'd get at Bubbalou's. The fried okra was awful. It tasted stale and over fried, like they had made the fried okra fresh a few days ago and then refried them today to try and pass them off. The cornbread was okay. It had jalape√±os baked into it and some kind of sugar glaze on top. It had a lot going on, but it was good.\\n\\nAfter we finished the food, we wanted to try some of their dessert, so we peeked at the bakery. They had a lot of cupcakes, which are simply not my thing (I can't get over the cake to icing ratio) so we opted for one of their dessert (mousse I want to say?) cups at the counter. We chose the peanut butter cup option. \\n\\nThis was simply disgusting. Do NOT get their dessert mousse things. The first bite I took I expected it to be whipped cream, but instead it was this whipped cream icing hybrid that was way too sugary. It also had these weird gelatinous pieces in it - think breast implant silicon gelatinous pieces. I thought it might just be the icing, and tried to just eat the mousse, but they were all over the dessert! It seriously grossed me out and I was done after two bites. My boyfriend took a few more bites and all of his had the gelatinous pieces as well and we ended up throwing away 3/4 of a dessert. It was a really awful ending to our dining experience.\\n\\nSo, all in all, it was okay. I still don't understand the hype surrounding this place, but it is better than its competitors. However, given the options, I think I'll just avoid barbecue altogether.\",\n",

During lunch and dinner hours it is way too busy. I don't want to stand in line for 20 minutes and there is minimal seating. I also hate the cafeteria style dining. Why do I have to sit with people I don't know? They could stink or eat like a slob. After dining in once I pick-up my order and the process is quick and simple. The food is pretty good. First time I went I got the Texas Destroyer and was not destroyed. The last few times I've ordered the burnt ends dinner and I enjoy it. My fianc√© doesn't like their meats. She does like BBQ but just doesn't like their style. She's ordered burnt ends, pulled pork, and pulled chicken sandwich and been unimpressed by all. Always says her hometowns BBQ blows it out the water. She loves the sides though. She'll get the side sampler and raves about the cornbread (a little spicy but great), mac n cheese, bbq beans, and smoked corn. Their corn has tomato chunks and is really good. The biscuits are a joke. I love the bbq beans and mac n cheese. Ok place when I'm craving BBQ especially considering there's nowhere else around to get it. Oh their sweet shop is really good. Reese's cup, cookie dough, and Oreo cupcakes are delicious and they're huge.\",\n",

ALTHOUGH, I'm going to add one incredibly serious caveat... 4R needs to stop jacking around with the burnt ends recipe. 100% serious as a heart attack.  STOP MESSING WITH THE BURNT ENDS!!!!!!\\n\\nI'll get back to that, but the food is amazing.  The smoked flavor is strong and clean.  The meat is juicy and flavorful.  The crowds are here and the line can get a bit long, but the food is worth it.\\n\\nIf it's your first time here, grab a paper menu while you wait.  Know what you want by the time you get to the meat counter.  You order your meal with the first person, but you don't need to tell that person which sides you want.  Move down the line and the next person will ask you about your sides.  Most meals come with either 2 or 3 sides.  Then you get a drink and pay at the register.  They have a 4R club, so you can earn free food if you sign up.\\n\\n*TIP TIME* I'll add this to the tips section, but some people don't really read those so I'll put it here, too.  If you want to make 4R a little more reasonably priced for your family, order off the bulk menu.  A family of 4-6 people will save at least half off their bill by doing this.  You don't get the fancy menu items, but get the best food.  Order the meats by the half or full pound and get a sideboard of either 3 or 5 sides.  My wife & I do this for just the 2 of us and it still saves us $5-7 each visit.\\n\\n*BURNT ENDS RANT*  I love all of the meats, but my favorite is the burnt ends.  4R has classically served theirs in the pulled style.  I've read that in Kansas City burnt ends are usually served cubed, but most of the rest of the country serves them either in thin slabs (think bacon style) or pulled.  Recently, 4R moved from their classic pulled style to cubed.  Honestly, it looked like dog food and the bulk of the taste is gone.  Cube style, in my opinion, makes what is supposed to be the best of the best of the brisket into a chew toy.  They also seem to have altered the seasoning rub they use on this cut.  It went from my favorite to an item I wouldn't order ever again.\\n\\nThis must have caused an uproar because they have changed it AGAIN.  My most recent visit, I asked about it before I ordered.  The guy sheepishly told me that I wasn't the only person that hated the dog food cubes and I wasn't the only one who said it looked like dog food.  He said it was a big deal for a lot of people.  They have gone back to the original seasoning rub, but have gone to a combo meal on the cubing.  It isn't back to purely shredded meat in the pulled style... there are cubes mixed in.  I'm hoping they ditch this and go back to the original.\\n\\nI asked the guy to try and leave as many cubes as he could out of my meal.  He was great and tried, but said he couldn't be super thorough with the line as long as it was.  I understood completely.  He did a pretty good job.\\n\\nUltimately, they are jacking around with the best item on the menu and that stinks.\",\n",

It doesn't matter if you order the pulled pork, the chopped chicken, the meaty ribs, or the beef brisket ...you'll get A LOT of food!  I always split something with whomever I'm with so I can split a giant dessert, HANDMADE in the restaurant.   It's AMAZING!  And Johnny Rivers is a super-nice guy, and gives A LOT back to the community, which is just a big plus to his BBQ perfection!\",\n",

Not 100% sure, just my impression on my first visit.  May pose as a problem during super busy hours. \\n\\nOn my first visit at this location I ordered the half rack of ribs with corn mash, cornbread salad, and fried pickles.  The corn mash was aromatic, buttery, and sweet. Cornbread salad as fabulous as usual. The fried pickles were not a big serving, would have loved more cause it was so good.  The pickles are definitely preserved and made in house.  My half rack of ribs could have been a bit warmer for my taste, but they were still fall off the bone delicious.  \\n\\nThe fiancee enjoyed her Burnt Ends sandwich along with the beans and fried okra as sides. \\n\\nDefinitely looking forward to coming back during lunch, very convenient location as it is right by work.

The ribs are five star, the brisket, which we had sliced instead of pulled, was ok but could have been brined a bit both to soften up the interior a bit more and to give it a little more pop. Their sausage is championship barbecue grade.  Sides rocked for flavor, with killer mac and cheese, and cole slaw and fried okra that was crisp and dry.  The collard greens were too chopped up for my sense of mouth feel, but they were tasty.  The front counter has every form of root beer imaginable, including hard to find ones like Eli\\'s from Maine and one from Boston. They could use one more person cleaning and a bit more detail there as the table was sticky, which brings us to the one dropped star:\\n\\nThe barbecue sauce.  Strictly Southern.  They make meat that would stand up well against Oklahoma Joes in Kansas City and is just a notch down from Rudy\\'s BBQ in Texas, but the \"regular sauce\" is too vinegary and the hot sauce, while packing enough heat. lacks that twang you find in Mid-Western and Texas \\'cue. \\n\\nRib jokes aside, toss us a bone and have a memphis or texas offering in the sauce department, and you get my star and my thanks.\\n\\nThe desserts, cakes, pies, cupcakes and the like, were rockin, but we were too full to take the plunge.

Was disappointed because the Burnt Ends was mostly hard chunks of meat with only a few \"burnt\" ends and was a mix of tiny pieces and chunks. The \"Pulled Chicken\" was not \"Pulled\" at all. It was evidently put in a food processor and ground into tiny pieces. The Collards were just okay and they didn\\'t bother draining the juice out. The Slaw was pretty good. I asked the cashier if they had Coke Zero and she said yes, but that wasn\\'t true when I got to the fountain machine. I\\'ve had the real deal when it comes to BBQ and unfortunately, this place fell way short for me.

       "  'text': \"While planning catering from 4 Rivers a debate ensued about which sides to order. The only way to decide was to make the trek out to the restaurant and sample them again and pick our favorites. (I love arguments over food.)\\n\\nSince all of the locations are a hike from where I work we decided to try the new spot by UCF. It was easy to find and there was plenty of parking. We arrived close to noon and the line was right at the door. There was a little congestion getting inside. I would guess our wait was about 10 minutes. While waiting my coworker pulled up an app on his phone that measures the noise level. (Neat-o.) Turns out the decibel rating at 4 Rivers during lunch time is actually loud enough to damage your hearing. So, keep that in mind. You may want to sit outside. \\n\\nI ordered the Six Shooter stack with cheese grits, pulled pork, coleslaw, pickles, and hot peppers. It is amazing. Pretty much the most perfect thing ever. \\n\\nMost of the rest of the group ordered sandwiches. Everyone was happy. \\n\\nSo... the outcome of the debate over sides? We decided to double-carb with cheese grits and mac & cheese. We also ordered the coleslaw because we all agreed it is great on the sandwiches (and we needed to have a veggie). So there you have it. All of the sides are great, but those are our picks. \\n\\nAnd a side note... my husband picked up a cupcake while we were here and dropped it off at my daughter's school as a treat for her. A cupcake in an adorable pink container. And it was promptly stolen (though half-eaten). Lock up your sweets, kids. People will steal those cupcakes, they're so good.\",\n",

When I questioned them, they stated that the beef is very expensive. They also are a bit pricey, and very cheap on the sides. They measure your sides. You are served on a food tray with a piece of paper towel under your food. You carry that to any table and find a seat. They have long picnic tables where you sit with other people. It's fun. You also get your own drinks. I haven't gone back there for awhile as I like the beef ribs or beef brisket or burnt ends and won't pay them the price they ask. I can make it at home.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This is the best restaurant in Orlando for Texas BBQ. My favorite dish is the Texas Destroyer. It's a brisket sandwich with provolone, onion rings & jalape√±os. You can get the meal & add 2 sides for a couple bucks more. They have unlimited fountain drinks and they carry a wide variety of bottled drinks, sodas & juices. They have a dessert section. They make cakes, cookies, milk shakes, etc.The food is a bit pricey but the quality is excellent. Don't be surprised to see a line out the door during the lunch rush. If you're in a hurry, I suggest placing your order over the phone to avoid the line. You can pick up your food and sit at any of the tables they have available. Seating is first come first serve. They have an outdoor seating area that's great on sunny days. This place is busy so it's great for large parties & families. The staff is always great here. There's plenty of parking.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'This restaurant has a cult following. I do enjoy their take on bbq. The actual place itself is relatively new, has both individual tables to sit and community style seating. Usually I go in thru their To-Go door and take the food home. The place is almost always busy, and I just prefer to eat the food in the comfort on my own home. The to-go orders usually take between 5-10 minutes from the time I order until my food is ready. \\n\\nAs for the food itself, I would say 80% of the time the food is great. The burnt ends (nice toasty pieces of brisket) are phenomenal. I am also partial to their pulled pork. When I order the dinner plate of pulled pork, the portion size is generous enough for me to eat half for dinner and the other half the next day. The sweet potato casserole is good, although I wish they would add more nuts into their recipe. The mac n cheese is also extremely creamy (which is how I feel mac n cheese should be). The southern green beans are hit and miss. Sometimes they lack seasoning in my opinion. The biscuits, when done right, are amazing, buttery and flaky. I have had them when they must not have been freshly baked, and were hard and crumbly.  \\n\\nAnd the prices are not bad if you stick with the basics. If you start adding additional meats/sides/etc, you can easily up your meal price to $18+. But as a general rule, this place will not disappoint. Its barbeque. Its good. It kinda puts you in a food coma. Worth it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'My introduction to 4 Rivers started awhile ago, but I never knew it. You see, I would always notice these black bumper stickers on the back of cars that had a peace sign, a heart, and \"something else\", but until I went to 4 Rivers, I never realized that the \"something else\" was actually their logo. My first visit was to the Winter Park location, and it\\'s clearly easy to see how the line can be out the door at times, as I made it just as the line started to creep inside. For my first-ever order, I chose the pulled pork, with french fries, macaroni and cheese, and potato salad. The meal also came with a biscuit. \\n\\nAs is to be expected, with such a following that 4 Rivers has, the pulled pork was excellent, as it should be for a BBQ restaurant. However, the one thing that disappointed me and ultimately made this a 4, not 5 star review, was the sides. The french fries are maybe marginally better than Ore Ida fries you\\'d get in a bag at the grocery store, but they\\'re clearly not fresh. The macaroni and cheese is watery and bland, lacking any real flavor, texture, or consistency as it swims in a cheese sauce. Lastly, the potato salad might as well be called a dill salad, because I tasted enough dill for about twice the amount of potato salad than I had.\\n\\nSadly enough, my second visit to the University Blvd. location confirmed two things: The side dish issue appears to be systemic and chicken quesadillas should not be ordered at a non-mexican restaurant. Again, I tried the french fries which tasted the same, albeit were slightly more crispy than the Winter Park location. The Mac and Cheese however, was still a runny, tasteless, disappointing mess. The quesadilla contained great tasting BBQ chicken, but the \"quesa\" part of the \"dilla\"  that typically helps hold it together, seemed to be missing, and it proceeded to fall apart. This caused me to have to eat the chicken with a fork, separate from the tortilla, which sort of defeated the purpose of the dish altogether.\\n\\nOne thing saving this review from being worse is the hospitality. In the Winter Park location I never had to get up to refill my drink, as the lady circling the room would always notice when I needed more. In the University location, a staff member offered to get my mom some water so she didn\\'t have to get up and get it herself. I was also swiftly assisted by two employees who, when I dropped one of my cups on the way to the fountain, promptly grabbed another cup for me. \\n\\nOverall, 4 Rivers falls victim to one main problem, and that is paying so much attention to one area that everything else seems to be an afterthought. Just because you serve great barbecue doesn\\'t mean you can serve mediocre side dishes. Five Guys serves really great burgers, but they also make really good and \"fresh\" fries. One day soon, hopefully, the quality of the hospitality and tasty barbecue will soon be matched by the side dishes, because that is what would really make this place top notch.',\n",

Folded inside said tortilla is usually some type of cheese, a protein, say chicken or beef. Often times there are some extras; saut√©ed onions, peppers, tomato, the possibilities are endless. Served with the quesadilla at bare minimum is usually some salsa. Better establishments will go so far as to serve you sour cream and guacamole. \\n\\nThen there is the 4 rivers quesadilla which is a tortilla filled with pulled chicken--period.

If you say anything negative about 4 Rivers you better expect a lightning strike and the zapping of your tongue inside your heathen mouth. \\nI get the brisket and the sausage. Those are my favorites, but they have other excellent offerings like ribs, smoked wings, burnt ends, pork, chicken and jalape√±o poppers. \\nI think some of what sets 4 Rivers apart from other BBQ spots is that they use really high quality beef for their brisket and other meats. I have eaten at most of the locations and they are all consistently good with really good meat. They don\\'t cut any corners and it tastes that way. \\nThey also offer good sides. I prefer their collard greens and corn, but their other sides are good too. The greens come complete with big hunks of meat and minced garlic. I\\'d love to copy the corn recipe at home if it weren\\'t so prep intensive. If I had any complaint it would be that their mac and cheese is pretty basic, but that is stretching it. \\nTheir ice machine and drinks are even good. For those of you from NC or SC you\\'ll be happy to see they offer Cheerwine which you can\\'t find everywhere. \\nThey have good sauces to compliment their BBQ also. I like the hot sauce. It has a little kick, but not much in my opinion. They also added a mustard sauce and it is really good with the sausage. It might look/sound strange, but I like to mix the mustard sauce and hot sauce. \\nThey also offer a ton of desserts, but I\\'m there for the meat and haven\\'t tried desserts yet. I\\'ll save that for an update. \\nEnjoy!\\n********\\nMy Standardized Yelp Ratings\\n5 stars - This is for a place that I see as one of the best at what they do (steaks, sandwiches, BBQ, seafood, etc). 5s are for places I\\'ve been several times (typically) at least and never had an \"off\" experience. The food quality, service, price and atmosphere are all going to meet or exceed expectations.\\n \\n4 stars - This is for a place that is good, I would drive a little out of the way to go, and the food and service is good, but maybe not amazing. Also for me, this could also be a great place that serves Pepsi products - automatic 1 star loss - bad management decision. \\n\\n3 stars - This is for a place that I view as standard. Nothing special, nothing lousy, not a place you\\'d avoid like the plague, but a place that is not one you really look forward to either. \\n\\n2 stars - This is for a place that had something go wrong or something perpetually wrong. The food and or service is likely consistently suspect here (they probably serve Pepsi too).\\n\\n1 star - I can\\'t see wasting time writing a review on a place that gets a 1 star. This is for a place that should consider closing.',\n",

I was drawn by the woody smoke aroma in the air. I walk in and the place is pretty busy. I stand in line and like what I see. As I get closer to my turn I watch some Guy trimming the Brisket. It is a new one and he cuts through and folds the fat cap back leaving just a bit for flavor and some bark. It's my turn. I order the $17+ Brisket Platter with sides. Now back to the Guy...he continues trimming away and I am impressed. I know brisket, I personally smoke them myself. I try it everywhere I go for work. Each is unique in size and shape. I like how this guy is ensuring each customer will get a nice portioned couple of slices. The guy trims and drops the crumbled fat and garbage in the trash by his side a few times and then... he takes the next handful of rejected garbage and puts this pile of disgusting crap on my assigned tray. I couldn't believe it! The next Trays were Sausage and then Sliders of sorts and then another Brisket Platter that got 3 beautiful slices. At this point my Sides were being scooped and that is when I reached the best decision of my day. I walked out! Not today ( or any day) 4 Rivers.\",\n",

The time from ordering to actually paying at the register was a bit absurd; probably around 10 minutes to move 10 feet. They aren't the best with bringing out the food either, as the BBQ Brisket Quesadillas we ordered took around 20 minutes to come out to our table, and by that time we were ready to go.\\n\\nI wasn't impressed with the portion size at all. The Pulled Chicken was just above the size of a slider, and was about 60% bun, 40% chicken. Same goes for the brisket. I did enjoy the brisket, although it was a bit dry, and needed more juice to it. The BBQ sauces were not on the tables there, you had to go over to the counter to get them, but very little signage pointing them out. We also had the sides of Mac & Cheese, and Potato Salad. I'll say the Mac & Cheese was fine, but nothing to write home about; and after one bite of the Potato salad, I'd had enough. Like I said above, the brisket quesadillas came out pretty late, but when we had them they were actually good. A bit dry, but in a good way.\\n\\nInside the restaurant, all the tables are massive picnic style tables, so not much privacy, and it isn't too comfortable to sit on the seats. When it comes to price, being next to UCF, I'd think the prices would be a bit more reasonable, but they weren't. Considering the portion size, I don't think we got the best bang for our buck. \\n\\nFood (B), Pricing (D-), Atmosphere (B-), Service (C+)\",\n",

Woo!)\\n\\nLike every other location I\\'ve been to, if you show up at even CLOSE to a peak time, there will be a line out the door. Luckily, it\\'s a fast-moving line. And there\\'s a separate line for to-go orders, so that speeds things up as well.\\n\\nThe Texas Destroyer was my sandwich of choice this time around, with incredibly tender brisket topped with an onion ring, cheese and jalepe√±o slices.  The fried okra was crispy and hot -- right out of the fryer hot. The baked beans are intensely flavored and barbecue-y. This makes for a huge meal, and I couldn\\'t even finish the beans (I took them home, you can\\'t let them go to waste!).  You can get just one side, but it\\'s only about an extra 20 cents to get the second side, so you might as well.  My suggestion, if you\\'re with one other person and you each get a sandwich, one person can get the 2 sides and then split them with the other.\\n\\nEven though it\\'s a counter service restaurant, they still have a bunch of employees walking around, making sure everything is good with your meal and offering to get you anything you might need. It\\'s a nice touch.\\n\\nThere will be poor reviews. Those reviews will often consist of something like the following: \"Orlando doesn\\'t know what good BBQ is. I\\'ve been to [ place with good BBQ ] and I know what good BBQ is, and this isn\\'t it.\"\\n\\nLook, I\\'ve also been guilty of looking back through the rose-tinted glasses of my memory, fondly recalling some spectacular meal that, if I were to consider it objectively, might not hold up quite as well as I remember.  Get the best pizza maker in NYC to fly to Orlando and give him all the exact same ingredients. He\\'ll make a pizza and everyone that has ever been to NYC will claim that the Orlando pizza isn\\'t nearly as good.  So it\\'s best to take reviews with these sweeping generalizations with a grain of salt.\\n\\nAnd then just ignore them. Because the food here is fantastic!',\n",

We always used to travel to the winter park location and started going here once they opened this location closer to our Orlando house. This place has always been 5 stars to me but definitely not so much anymore. A couple months back, I noticed the delicious cupcakes they have had gotten smaller, a lot smaller, but of course the price didn't. The girl I had spoken to said they were trying to make the cupcakes more profitable and desirable. I guess they were too big and people weren't ordering them. Making them smaller and keeping the price the same isn't quite the way to go. \\nFast forward to yesterday when my dad and I went here before taking the kids to the parks. We each got the pulled pork sandwich. My dad was watching them make his sandwich and when the sandwich maker was done, he slid the tray to the girl doing the sides. My dad had to ask if that was all the meat he was getting. The gentleman apologized and put more pulled pork on. I had no idea this had happened because I was up ahead of him and sidetracked by the kids. We sat down and when I took the bun off my sandwich to add some of their awesome sauce, I was astounded by how little meat was on my sandwich. This was twice now because on my last visit my sandwich was ridiculously small. My dad told me he had to say something and got more meat. In all fairness, he did make me a new sandwich but the quality of the pork was not what it used to be. I certainly hope these guys aren't going to use their business model they implemented in their dessert area of making their serving sizes smaller to keep the profit margin higher but one can only assume that's the case. If so, I definitely won't be back to any 4R locations.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Okay this extremely disappointing. Went on a Saturday night and it was packed. I thought this would be a good sign and the pleasant aromas upon walking up to the establishment gave a good omen. That is where the pleasant experience ended. I walked up to see a long queue and then someone mentioned that there was no seating available at the moment and that I might want to get it to go. On the side they did have a place where you could order separately to get your to-go orders and the service was quick. This ends the last positive things I will stay about this restaurant. I ordered the two meat platter featuring the pulled pork and brisket. They enclosed two small packets of sauce and it appears you only have one choice of sauce. The pulled pork was inedible it tasted like cotton balls it was so dried out. I could taste that there was smoke flavor but even with the corn syrup sauce it was inedible. The brisket was better and it had a decent taste but again it was not tender it was dried out and probably the worst brisket i've ever had in my life. I did not try the chicken or the sausage that might be better; however, I would not return just to try them as a gamble. The two sides I had, macaroni and cheese and baked beanswere okay; however, I don't go to a barbecue restaurant just to enjoy sides. I do believe, which is just based from this one experience, that this is a restaurant based on hype and marketing and not on true quality. I won't be back.\",\n",

First I had to pass by what apperared to be the majority of staff gathered outside by the take-out area all enjoying a tasty cigarette.  I ordered the 3 sliders so I too could have a taste of the pulled pork, which was the star in my opinion, second was the Angus Brisket which wasn\\'t bad but had nothjing on the pulled pork, and finally the burnt ends which kinda looked like black bear poop and regardless of the taste still looked like poop.  Over all I would return again but stick to the pulled pork.  Seems this location has some rough edges still but is worth consideration.  Oh, one more thing, my food was cold, but because I got it to go I just figured I would heat it up once I got home.  I like a good bbq restaurant, so I hope they can get this place figured out.  Ok, a second thing worth noting is their \"sweet shop\" leaves a lot to be desired, as they have nothing on Too Jays Deli which is really a \"sweet shop\", the carrot cake was dry.  Please understand though, I will be going back looking for improvements!',\n",

We had been given a gift card and decided to put it to good use.  Now I love some good lip smacking BBQ, but didn\\'t have high hopes.  We went in and I ordered the Burnt Ends platter with jalapeno poppers, greens, and the baked beans.  I was thoroughly impressed with the burnt ends and the baked beans.  OMG the beans, a nice rich sauce, full of flavor.  Now those were lip smacking good.  The burnt ends were flavorful, not tough, and quite plentiful.  The greens were good, average.  The next time I will probably not get the jalapeno poppers.  I felt they could have been cooked a bit more and there was just no \"pop.\"  The sauces were fair.  i did not consider the hot hot, but it had plenty of flavor.  As we were leaving I stopped by the bake shop and decided to try a piece of red velvet cake, an all time favorite of mine, and got my husband a cookie.  The cake was moist, somewhat flavorful, but not like my mom made.

The building looks super fancy but has a very casual ambiance. \\n\\nThe food: \\n4 Rivers offers BBQ meats such as brisket, pork, chicken, turkey, sausage, etc. It was my first time here, so I sampled a lot of different things. The brisket is lean and juicy and the burnt ends are so flavorful. I tried several different sides: fries, potato salad, Mac n cheese, bread pudding, and spices green beans- all of which are amazingly delicious and are bursting with flavor. I got a special- the brisket burger and I added two sides. The burger was very good, although I asked for no tomatoes and still got them. It has an interesting sauce on top, it kind of reminded me of big mac sauce or a honey mustard of some sort. We also left with a piece of chocolate cake from the sweets shop which was AWESOME! \\n\\nThe service:\\nI was waiting a while for my brisket burger to finish being made, which is fine. A man who seemed to be a manager noticed me standing up front for a long time with a blank face and made sure if there was something I was waiting on. I highly appreciated that, after interacting with two other female FOH employees with bad attitudes. Not one smile. Not any bit of enthusiasm for their job or for what they're doing or just for customer service. I stood up at the counter to ask for a sample for five minutes and they made eye contact with me several times and neither of them cared to acknowledge my existence. And when somebody did, she acted completely annoyed and didn't make any eye contact. The girl who helped me at the little sweets shop was great though! Thank God for her. The other two should learn from her.\",\n",

I was not a 4 Rivers fan and couldn't figure out why people would recommend it. And then I came here...\\n\\nEither there has been a mega step up, or the other locations need to look at this one. I ordered online and got my order pretty quickly. I got a half rack w/ extra meat (chicken) and a side of fries and jalapeno corn bread. It was all delicious, the ribs were seasoned really well, and coated fine with some BBQ sauce. The chicken was very moist, one of the best BBQ chickens I have had in a while, and the sides were also good, although I would have preferred a bigger side of fries. To round it all up, I really enjoyed the sauces, specially the spicy 4 sauce. Really good stuff and I do suggest you stop by this location.\",\n",

The food, was ready fast and the stuff that was made to order was quickly brought to our table. Let me just say....we were pleasantly surprised.

It was such a great experience that it made us all want to rush home and try the Tampa location. I hope it lives up to the Orlando store!

The ribs were just fall off the bone spectacular with a nice spicy rub flavor underneath the sweet BBQ sauce mop.  The sides were righteous too  (mac'n'cheese, collards, corn, biscuits, baked beans).  Unfortunately the briscuit was too dry and overly salted - which kind of ruined the burnt ends experience and has me questioning the Texas pedigree of this place.  We ordered a pound and tossed half of it. The smoke was perfect however on both meats.  The ambience is relaxed and comfortable and the staff is very friendly.

I would recommend the brisket. They have salads but no one really orders them.

On this particular visit, I was excited to try their new Burnt Ends made from Beyond Meat (aka not real meat).\\n\\nOf all of the faux meats I have tried (Impossible Whopper at BK, Impossible Slider at White Castle, Beyond Taco at Del Taco), this is by far the best I've had.  I was surprised at how delicious this plant-based BBQ was.  Each bite was smokey, chewy, and tasted like any good barbecue I have had.  I give this product 5 stars for flavor.\\n\\nThe Thai Salad was a little lacking in flavor for me.  All of the veggies were fresh, I was just expecting more punch or something.  Maybe the Beyond Burnt Ends were so good that it made this salad pale in comparison, who knows.  It wasn't bad, but I'm not ordering that again.\\n\\nMy wife enjoyed the Six Shooter sandwich.

You can't go wrong. Pulled pork was fantastic and their bbq sauce was scrumptious. My hubby got their St. Louis ribs and Mac and cheese. Wow! Get the ribs! I wish I had.

I love this place.\\n\\nI ordered the Burnt-Ends (4R signature brisket shredded with pulled pork, smothered with signature sauce and re-smoked to perfection) Dinner with three sides (smoked jalapenos, french fries, and fried okra) and a biscuit. My girlfriend for the Pulled Pork Dinner with three sides (4R BBQ Beans, Mac & Cheese, and the Bread Pudding) and Texas Cornbread.\\n\\nSo a couple tips. First of all, you can substitute Texas Cornbread for the biscuit when you order a dinner, and I recommend you do it. Their cornbread is to die for. Also, in case you didn't know this, the Bread Pudding here is made with Krispy Kreme donuts. I don't think I have to say anything more here. It's delicious. It's not too sweet, contrary to what you're probably imagining right now. \\n\\nThe burnt ends is my favorite meat here. It's so smoky and tender and juicy, you don't even need the sauce on there for it to be delicious. The smoked jalapenos are always amazing. They're smoked with a piece of cheese in them and wrapped in bacon. My only complaint is that I only get two as a side. French fries were crinkle cut, standard. The fried okra is always hit or miss, honestly. This time, it was a hit. I loved them. Super crunchy with the okra still ok and delicious inside the breading. \\n\\nMy girlfriend's pulled pork was also delicious. I like pulled pork that's not like, too fatty. Just meat. So good. Her beans were beans, and the mac & cheese was mac & cheese. Standard stuff, but the standard is appreciated compared to when other restaurants get it wrong. \\n\\nSo if you haven't come here yet, and you're reading this, please come here. Please. Please.\",\n",
